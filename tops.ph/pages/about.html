                    <h1 class="brand-title medium">The off-price store</h1>
                </div>

                <div class="col s12 l9">
                    <p>The Off-Price Store was launched as a fresh concept right after Star Trends sold “Urban Outlet”. The
                        stores were no longer to be placed in malls, but rather, in areas not readily identified as retail
                        store spaces. This break in monotony and the professional manner in which merchandising and marketing
                        were handled led to the steady profits of the first store.</p>

                    <p>Until recently, The Off-Price Store was operating as a business unit under Star Trends. By the fourth
                        store, the company decided to make the retail business run independently, formally incorporating
                        Off-Price.
                    </p>

                    <p>The Off-Price Stores Corp. was incorporated on August of 2007 and set the growth of The Off-Price Store
                        at 25 branches in 5 years. The target is set at a modest 1 store per quarter. To spearhead this growth
                        and ensure that the stores achieve their targets, Management relies on the store managers who are
                        well-trained for the job.</p>

                    <p>In 2009, The Off-Price Store created the acronym TOPS and redesigned the logo to fit in with the ever-changing
                        world of retail. We plan to keep up with the demand for fashion at prices everyone can afford. It
                        is what we believe in.</p>
